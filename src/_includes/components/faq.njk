        <button class="accordion">What will be the visual impact of the wind turbine on the area?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                A Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment will be carried out by a qualified person prior to submission of the planning application, the results of which will be available upon completion of the assessment.

        <button class="accordion">What is Shadow Flicker?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                Shadow flicker occurs in the profile of the wind turbine and is the flickering effect caused by the rotation of the turbine's blades. The effect of shadow flicker on surrounding properties will be assessed in the Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment

        <button class="accordion">How loud will the turbine be?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                Turbines generally have a low decibel level of c. 50 dB at a distance of 300m. Regarding this project, there are no dwellings within this 300m diameter, and sounds dissipates relatively quickly beyond this. 50dB is seen as a safe sound level and will not cause any harm to hearing.

        <button class="accordion">How will the turbine effect birds in the area?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                Birds striking blades can happen at wind turbine developments. However, there is evidence that birds become aware of the blade paths and avoid the blade sweep area of the turbine. Cumulatively, with the other turbines in the area there is unlikely to be any large disturbance as they are well distanced from each other. An impact assessment for birds and bats will be carried out by a qualified person and made available to the public.

        <button class="accordion">Will the turbine have any impact on the waters of Cork Harbour?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                The project has no interaction with the waters in Cork Harbour and will not cause any effect. It is located in an industrial area c. 160m from the closest point on the shore, an intertidal area to the south.

        <button class="accordion">Where will the turbine be?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                The proposed site for the turbine is located to the north of the main Hovione campus, near an overflow carpark in an unoccupied plot.
            </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Who will the turbine supply?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                The turbine will generate power solely for the Hovione Ringaskiddy campus in line with plans to reduce carbon emissions of the plant.

        <button class="accordion">Why was the turbine chosen?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                The Enercon 4.3 MW Wind Turbine is a popular model, with over 600 constructed across the world since the model was launched in 2020. This popularity is due to the versatility of the model, which is able to withstand a wide array of weather conditions, in conjunction with high energy yields which can be produced. Additionally, it is optimised for noise control, ensuring a minimal impact on the surrounding area.

        <button class="accordion">What phase is it in?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                The construction of the turbine is still currently in the planning and investigation phase. The necessary visual and environmental impact assessment reports are being conducted and will inform future steps as the project moves forward.

        <button class="accordion">What effect will the turbine have on wildlife?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p class="faq-text">
                Ecological surveys conducted by qualified specialists are currently underway to assess the potential impacts of the turbine construction and operation. Necessary mitigation plans will be drawn up following the results of these surveys.
